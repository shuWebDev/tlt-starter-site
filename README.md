# TLT Project Setup

## Installation

Please make sure that you have changed directory to your project folder. Once you've changed directories, clone the repository with the following:

```shell
$ git clone https://shu-web-development.git.beanstalkapp.com/tlt-projects.git
```

After you've cloned the repository, initialize the "*globals*" submodule. More information about submodules can be found here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules.

```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
